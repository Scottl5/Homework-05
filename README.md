# Homework-05
This is my submission for Homework #5. This homework required us to make a work day scheduler. It provided me with CSS and some HTML. I used Bootstrap to create the table. Within the Javascript, I created an if function that checked to see if a given hour was in the past, present, or future. Depending on what it was, the background color of the textarea box would change. I created several functions for each hour so that they could be saved within local storage. I then created a function that allowed the tasks to stay if the user refreshed the page.
